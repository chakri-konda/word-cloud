# word-cloud

This project is word cloud image generation from the raw text data given in a string format by cleaning it like removing punctuations and uninteresting words from the string. I did this as an end assignment for crash course on python by Google.

For example,
I took the text data from the first few lines of 'Artificial Intelligence' encyclopedia and based on their word frequencies the ouptut image generated is shown below
